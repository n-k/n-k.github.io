## About this blog
The initial posts are going to be about setting up this blog itself. This website
is running on a Raspberry Pi 4 at my home. The pi runs a single node kubernetes install
where everything you see here in hosted.

Before you think kubernetes is massive overkill for a blog - I'm planning posts on
a few topics, including on kubernetes, which will need a server, even if its a tiny pi.
